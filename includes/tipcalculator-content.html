    <h1>Make Me Choose</h1>
    <p>Make Me Choose is an iOS application for therapists who work with people with autism. This small side project was done with myself as programmer, and my friend, who is a Speech Language Pathologist.</p>
    

    <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
    <p>Swift, iOS</p>

    <h3>What Was The Application?</h3>
    <p>The application was based around flash cards. The person who will mostly be controlling it will be the therapist and they will be working with someone with autism. There are currently only two categories for the therapist to choose from - fruits and vegetables. After choosing a category, the app will present three choices, and ask for the proper answer. The therapist will then have the patient pick the appropriate picture. Once picked, the app will either congratulate the correct choice, or tell them to try again. In the case the patient is memorizing the position of the picture, the therapist can use the "Shuffle" button to move the pictures around.   </p>
    
    <h3>History Behind The Game</h3>
    <p>I was chatting with my friend regarding her job as a speech language pathologist and she mentioned that there aren't many Apps for them to use - it's either too expensive, or they have to use another children's application and use 10% of it to cater to those with autism. This was when I was first diving into iOS development, and I took this chance to try my hand at designing, working with a "client", and implementing it.

     <h3>Problems, Mistakes, and Lessons</h3>
     <p> The biggest problem I ran into was my <b>design</b>. Even though I had gone over an initial UI design with my friend, I didn't do a lot of coding design - thinking about what I need, thinking about what I can re-use, and thinking about some design patterns that will help me in the long run. I also didn't design enough of the layout and how the game would flow - I had only gone over how the game itself would look like. However, I knew this from the beginning, but I wanted to get my feet wet quickly and dove into it knowing I would have some coding pains later.
        
     <p>We definitely ran into a quite a few problems over the 20 weeks. At first everything went pretty smoothly and everyone was working well together,
     but the first problem was definitely <b>scheduling</b>. The first few weeks were completely fine before midterms and other projects started. When
     other classes started becoming a priority, it became harder to schedule productive meetings because not everyone would be there or not everyone
     was able to work on it at home as much as they wanted.
     </p>
     <p>Another problem we ran into was the <b>design</b> of our game. We quickly felt our game was just a copy of Fruit Ninja and it wasn't very unique.
     We decided to scrap____ </p>
     <p>A problem we didn't really realize until later in the quarter was <b>play testing.</b> We didn't really have anyone play test our early iterations
     of the game until a member brought a build of the game to a wedding and got feedback for it. Without this play test, we wouldn't have concluded that
     our game just wasn't fun. No one wanted to play it again, and their opinions were just, "Oh, that's nice." ____</p>
