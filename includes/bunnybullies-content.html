    <h1>Bunny Bullies</h1>
    <p>Bunny Bullies is a multiplayer phone game created for the Computer Game Science Project course at the
      University of California, Irvine. The team consisted of 5 members and was a project done over 20 weeks.</p>

    <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
    <p>C#, Unity</p>

    <h3>What Was The Game?</h3>
    <p>The game was a multiplayer Anroid game on the phone. Each player had a screen full of "trash" and needed to swipe the trash into "portals".
    These "portals" would connect to a certain player, and the special feature of this game is that the trash would go to that player's screen when swiped to.
    There were 3 rounds and each round lasted 30 seconds. At the end of each round, the player would be scored based on how much trash they collected, and
    how many bonus points they collected. </p>

    <h3>History Behind The Game</h3>
    <p>One of our members really wanted to make a game that used all functionalities of the phone: tapping, swiping, gyroscope, microphone, speakers, etc.
    We started off _____

     <h3>Problems, Mistakes, and Lessons</h3>
     <p>We definitely ran into a quite a few problems over the 20 weeks. At first everything went pretty smoothly and everyone was working well together,
     but the first problem was definitely <b>scheduling</b>. The first few weeks were completely fine before midterms and other projects started. When
     other classes started becoming a priority, it became harder to schedule productive meetings because not everyone would be there or not everyone
     was able to work on it at home as much as they wanted.
     </p>
     <p>Another problem we ran into was the <b>design</b> of our game. We quickly felt our game was just a copy of Fruit Ninja and it wasn't very unique.
     We decided to scrap the initial design and come up with a new design for the game. </p>
     <p>A problem we didn't really realize until later in the quarter was <b>play testing.</b> We didn't really have anyone play test our early iterations
     of the game until a member brought a build of the game to a wedding and got feedback for it. Without this play test, we wouldn't have been able to conclude that
     our game just wasn't <i>fun</i>, it wasn't addicting either. No one wanted to play it again, and their opinions were just, "Oh, that's nice." </p>
     <p><b>Communication</b> wasn't a problem at first, but when everyone got busy and meetings were a bit harder to make, we started doing things on our own.
     One member took it to himself </p>
     <p>Problem: Meeting Deadlines</p>

     <h3>Extra Notes</h3>
     <p>We had Blizzard mentors who helped us throughout the 20 weeks.</p>
