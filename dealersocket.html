			<h1>Dealersocket</h1>
			<p>I worked at Dealersocket from July 2016 until January 2017. My reason for leaving was because they didn't make enough money in 2016 so I was laid off.</p>

			<h3>Technology Stack</h3>
			<p>C#, Java, etc</p>

			<h3>What Did I Do?</h3>
			<p>I was an Associate Software Engineer at Dealersocket. For the first few months I was in training, where I watched Pluralsight videos and learned about
			____, ______, ______. The problem about this was that even though I learned about a lot of concepts, I wasn't able to put them into practical use, and
			ended up forgetting about most of the concepts I picked up.</p>
			<p>Once I got out of training, I was put onto a new 6-man team. We were part of a "whitespace" initiative where we would research new technologies and see if
			the company could use it. We researched technologies such as .NET Core, AuroraDB, DynamoDB, Apache Kafka, and many more. We also did a lot of work on creating
			a Master Data Management (MDM) model. </p>
